<H2>What drives you to book at Airbnb?</h2>
A data based look at Seattle and Boston's Airbnb data from 2016 and 2017<br><br>

<b>Introduction</b><br>
Airbnb is known for being the largest non-land owning hospitality brand in the world, but it needs more than a catchy name, and different style to drive business.<br>
Having never studied this company's data before, I thought we would cover a few basic bases first.<br><br>
We only used Boston and Seattle's listing and calendar data from 2016 and 2017, but if you're an aspiring data scientist, data artist, or other data type person, you could gather more here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html<br><br>
Our dataset included 7320 listings, 12378 beds, and 1 treehouse, with availability listings from 2016-01-04 to 2017-09-05
